    <h2><small><b>What is computer networking?</b></small></h2>
    <p>Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other. These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies.</p>
    <h3><big><p align = "center">Type of networks</p></big></h3>
    <p> <b> There are manny types of network</b></p>
    <ul><li>
        Lan (Local Area network)
    </li> <li>Wan (Wide are network)</li>
<li>Man (Metro political area network)</li>
<li>Personal Area Network (PAN)</li>
<li>Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)</li>
<li>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</li></ul>
<h1><b>Local Area Network</b></h1>
<p>LAN is the most frequently used network. A LAN is a computer network that connects computers together through a common communication path, contained within a limited area, that is, locally. A LAN encompasses two or more computers connected over a server. The two important technologies involved in this network are Ethernet and Wi-fi.</p>

<h2><b> <big> Wide area network</big></b></h2>
<p>WAN is a type of computer network that connects computers over a large geographical distance through a shared communication path. It is not restrained to a single location but extends over many locations. WAN can also be defined as a group of local area networks that communicate with each other.</p>
<h1><b>Metro political area network</b></h1>
<p>A MAN is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN. This is the type of computer network that connects computers over a geographical distance through a shared communication path over a city, town or metropolitan area.s</p>
<h2><b><big> Personal area network </big></b></h2>
<p>PAN is the most basic type of computer network. This network is restrained to a single person, that is, communication between the computer devices is centred only to an individual’s work space. PAN offers a network range of 10 meters from a person to the device providing communication.</p>
<h2><b><big>Wireless Local Area Network</big></b></h2>
<p>WLAN is a type of computer network that acts as a local area network but makes use of wireless network technology like Wi-Fi. This network doesn’t allow devices to communicate over physical cables like in LAN but allows devices to communicate wirelessly.</p>
<h2><b><big>Virtual Private Network</big></b></h2>
<img src=D:\verydanfer\vpe.jpg>
<p>A VPN is a type of computer network that extends a private network across the internet and lets the user send and receive data as if they were connected to a private network even though they are not. Through a virtual point-to-point connection users can access a private network remotely. VPN protects you from malicious sources by operating as a medium that gives you a protected network connection. </p>
